                <p>Hello! I am Gavin Corkery, I was born in Commerce, MI and now I live in Trenton, MI.
                I got into programming when I was a freshman in high school where I taught myself HTML and CSS and fell in love
                with coding and developing different things. I didn't focus on many other languages until my senior year of high school
                when I took AP Computer Science which was focused around making small video games in JavaScript, from that class
                I knew for sure that I wanted to be a software engineer and develop programs or websites that helped people and served
                a purpose for them. After high school I attended Henry Ford College in Dearborn, MI where I studied for my associates in Computer
                Science. In college I took classes on JavaScript, C, C#, Python, HTML, and CSS. <br><br>
                With 5 general study classes standing in my way of graduation, I chose to take a break from school and further my programming
                knowledge with a Full-Stack boot camp at devCodeCamp.
