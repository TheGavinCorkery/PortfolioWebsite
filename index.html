                <p class = "about-me-content">Hello! I am Gavin Corkery, I was born in Commerce, MI and now I live in Trenton, MI.
                I got into programming when I was a freshman in high school where I taught myself HTML and CSS and fell in love
                with coding and developing different things. I didn't focus on many other languages until my senior year of high school
                when I took AP Computer Science which was focused around making small video games in JavaScript, from that class
                I knew for sure that I wanted to be a software engineer and develop programs or websites that helped people and served
                a purpose for them. After high school I attended Henry Ford College in Dearborn, MI where I studied for my associates in Computer
                Science. In college I took classes on JavaScript, C, C#, Python, HTML, and CSS. <br><br>
                With 5 general study classes standing in my way of graduation, I chose to take a break from school and further my programming
                knowledge with a Full-Stack boot camp at devCodeCamp.

                                from multi-billion dollar industries. Along with improvements for the consumer, there is a new portal for employees. On their homepage,
                                they will see a google map view of all of their stops for the day, and only that day. This new interface allows an overhead view of where
                                they will be going on their route, and allow them to "complete" a customer pickup which will remove their pin from the map.
